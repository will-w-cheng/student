Ok so obviously this blog is gonna show our understanding of basic linux commands and everything relating to the Linux Shell bash tutorial because obviously we want a good grade on the pair review. However, this is something we're both experienced in and thus we're going to a little bit more in the theory behind what this blog is for.\n",

    "### Shared Libraries\n",
    "- Understanding Shared Libraries: In Unix-like systems, many programs rely on shared libraries (also known as dynamic link libraries) to perform various tasks. These libraries contain precompiled functions that programs can use. When a program is executed, the dynamic linker/loader (ld.so or ld-linux.so in Linux) loads these libraries into memory and resolves function calls to the appropriate library functions. Whereas staticly loaded libraries are quite literally embedded within the acutal executable. \n",
    "\n",
    "- An attacker with sufficient permissions (typically root or a user with sudo privileges) can set the LD_PRELOAD environment variable to specify a malicious shared library that they control. They can do this by exporting the variable in their shell session or by modifying the environment of a specific process. \n",
    "\n",
    "- So what if a normal user were compromised that was granted the sudo access to one binary, maybe to run a specific binary as that person or simply for inconvience? Well we can preload a malicious library with those permissions and escalate our permissions to sudo. But keep in mind we also need the loader to preserver the environmental changes in order to ensure that our malicious library runs"
